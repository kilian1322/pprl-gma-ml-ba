Code Base of my Bachelor's Thesis on the Characteristics of a Universal, Unsupervised Machine Learning Graph Matching Attack


To run experiments, execute the main.py script. 
For larger benchmarking test, benchmark.py provides a script to execute the run() function in main.py multiple times for different parameters.
The data from my own experiments can be seen in the .tsv files in the /data folder. However, they can also be recreated of course by running the same experiments as described in my Bachelor's Thesis.

Short overview of the files that I have added/that differ from the code base of the work conducted by Sch√§fer et al.:
1. main.py
2. benchmark.py
3. data_visualizion.py
4. data_visualization_errors.py
5. data_visualization_dummy_and_graph_matching.py
6. preprocessing.py
7. And in the /data folder:
  a. all benchmark_[...].tsv files
b. the files in the /Daten_PPRL folder
